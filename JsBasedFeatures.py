"""### **3.3.1. IFrame Redirection**

IFrame is an HTML tag used to display an additional webpage into one that is currently shown. Phishers can make use of the “iframe” tag and make it invisible i.e. without frame borders. In this regard, phishers make use of the “frameBorder” attribute which causes the browser to render a visual delineation. 

If the iframe is empty or repsonse is not found then, the value assigned to this feature is 1 (phishing) or else 0 (legitimate).

"""### **3.3.2. Status Bar Customization**

Phishers may use JavaScript to show a fake URL in the status bar to users. To extract this feature, we must dig-out the webpage source code, particularly the “onMouseOver” event, and check if it makes any changes on the status bar

If the response is empty or onmouseover is found then, the value assigned to this feature is 1 (phishing) or else 0 (legitimate).

"""### **3.3.3. Disabling Right Click**

Phishers use JavaScript to disable the right-click function, so that users cannot view and save the webpage source code. This feature is treated exactly as “Using onMouseOver to hide the Link”. Nonetheless, for this feature, we will search for event “event.button==2” in the webpage source code and check if the right click is disabled.

If the response is empty or onmouseover is not found then, the value assigned to this feature is 1 (phishing) or else 0 (legitimate).

"""### **3.3.4. Website Forwarding**
The fine line that distinguishes phishing websites from legitimate ones is how many times a website has been redirected. In our dataset, we find that legitimate websites have been redirected one time max. On the other hand, phishing websites containing this feature have been redirected at least 4 times.
